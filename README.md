Description of project:
There are many tools to aid in trip planning, covering transportation, lodging and other aspects of the trip. However, there is no convenient tool for travellers to find friends and acquaintances who are staying at the destination. We developed this application as a tool for travellers to not only identify friends staying at their destination, but also for them to communicate with these friends and set up meetings. To this end, we will leverage the data available on Facebook to identify the locations of the user’s friends, while use Google Maps to present this data in a clear and concise manner. Because of the universality of Facebook, it’s messaging service will also be our platform of choice for communicating with the user’s friends.
